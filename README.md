<h1>🕹️ Escape </h1>

A tiny webapp built to help introverts (like me!) gracefully escape awkward or exhausting social gatherings. When small talk becomes too much, Escape is here to rescue you — with a fake incoming call! 📞

🌐 Live Demo

📌 What is Escape?
Escape is a minimal and quirky webapp that simulates an incoming call to help you exit uncomfortable situations. Whether you need a "call" from your mom, your boss, or even a mysterious "unknown" number, this app has your back.

Perfect for introverts. Built for fun. Used when needed.

🚀 Features
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Choose who the "caller" is:

- Mom
- Friend
- Boss
- Unknown

⏳ Set the delay time for the incoming call:

- 5 seconds
- 30 seconds
- 1 minute

📲 Simulated call interface with a ringtone

Looks like a real call screen, but it's all fake — just for show!

🎯 Why I Made This
As an introvert, I often find myself in social situations where I just need an excuse to step away. So I built this tool for myself and others who might need a polite escape — with a touch of humor and tech.
